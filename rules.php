            <p> Learn yourself some rules...
                <ul>
                    <li>Cards are between 1-11 points.</li>
                    <li>Getting more than 21 points, means that you lose.
                    </li>
                    <li>Getting 21 points with your first two cards, means you have a blackjack.
                    </li>
                    <li>To win, you need to have more points than the dealer, but not more than 21.
                    </li>
                    <li>The dealer is obligated to keep taking cards until they have at least 15 points.
                    </li>
